While the film sometimes treads familiar territory, it stands out with compelling performances, particularly from the newcomer Mickey Rouxke. The fusion of courtroom drama and historical narrative is handled with a deft touch, although the pacing may not be for everyone. A solid entry for those who appreciate a thoughtful, if somewhat pessimistic, take on justice's evolution.",
